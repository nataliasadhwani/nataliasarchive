          <p>I grew up in Subic Bay, Philippines. I was fortunate to be raised in a vibrant, culturally diverse community that shaped my global perspective from an early age. With two incredibly supportive parents who have continuously inspired my drive for excellence and personal growth, I attribute all my achievements to their unwavering encouragement. Living in Subic Bay provided me with the opportunity to gain valuable insights into different cultures, traditions, and ways of life, significantly enriching my adaptability, communication skills, and appreciation for diversity. These formative experiences have profoundly influenced my academic pursuits, professional endeavors, and personal values.</p>
