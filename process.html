      <h2>Project Planning</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="process-intro">
      The planning phase of my site, Natalia’s Archive, focused on building a well-structured, user-friendly website that aligned with the project expectations. I began by outlining the overall site structure and identifying key goals for layout, navigation, and content flow. I made sure to emphasize maintaining visual consistency, integrating multimedia elements effectively, and ensuring a seamless user experience across all pages. This guided my decisions around design inspiration, accessibility, and content organization.

        <h3>Part 1: Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>This stage involved developing a logical information architecture that ensured intuitive navigation while fulfilling all required project components, including a homepage, highlight gallery, resume, process documentation, and contact form. Using a node-link diagram, I mapped out both global and local navigation structures, along with associative and utility navigation components. This diagram helped visualize how users would interact with the site and how content would be layered and interconnected across different sections. Priority was given to organizing content in a way that balances visual appeal with accessibility and ease of use.</p>

        <h3>Part 2: Inspiration/Mood Boards</h3>
        <p>To guide the visual identity and layout of Natalia’s Archive, I curated a Pinterest mood board that captured the aesthetic I wanted to achieve. This board included references for color palettes, typography, layout styles, and interface components that aligned with my personal brand. Drawing inspiration from modern, clean, and expressive website designs, I used this collection to inform choices in layout structure, font pairings, and color contrasts. The mood board served as a creative foundation that helped translate my vision into a cohesive and visually appealing digital experience.</p>

        <h3>Part 3: Wireframes</h3>
        <p>Wireframing allowed me to create a structural blueprint of each page before implementing visuals and content. I designed low-fidelity wireframes that outlines the structure of content, including navigation placement, text areas, image blocks, and interactive elements. These sketches laid the foundation for responsive behavior and helped identify layout issues early in the design process, allowing for user-centric adjustments before moving into high-fidelity prototyping.</p>

        <h3>Part 4: Prototypes</h3>
        <p>After finalizing the layout and visual identity, I brought the wireframes to life by developing interactive prototypes to test usability, interactivity, and visual coherence. The prototypes incorporated real content, visuals, and styling elements. This stage focused on applying the chosen color palette, typography, and layout structure to create a polished, functional preview of the final website. It allowed me to understand how users would experience the site’s navigation, content flow, and overall interface. These iterations were crucial for spotting inconsistencies, refining transitions, and ensuring that design decisions aligned with both usability standards and aesthetic goals.</p>

        <h3>Part 5: Accessibility (WebAIM, WCAG 2.0)</h3>
        <p>Throughout the design of Natalia’s Archive, I prioritized accessibility by following WCAG 2.0 guidelines and using the WebAIM contrast checker to ensure visual clarity. I selected high-contrast color combinations—such as dark navy text on light backgrounds and bold button colors—to meet or exceed the recommended contrast ratios for readability. I also used clear, descriptive headings and labels to support screen readers and keyboard navigation. Visual hierarchy and consistent layout across pages were carefully planned to create an inclusive, user-friendly experience for all visitors.</p>
